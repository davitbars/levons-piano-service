    "description": "This rare gold leaf hand-painted Hamburg Steinway was meticulously decorated in Paris, France and completed in 1897. It was once owned by Adolfo Lopez Mateo, President of Mexico from 1958 through 1964. The finish possesses a natural patina due to its age. The sound is unmistakably 'Hamburg' and rivals any contemporary piano in its size range. The Steinway Model C, measuring 7'5\", was historically produced only in Hamburg and is considered one of Steinway’s most balanced and versatile large grands. ",
